`#question`
#### Which primitive type from `int, short, double` could be used to make it output `0`?
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ____ value;
    System.out.println(value);
}
```

`#answer`
**Compilation Error** as `value` variable is not initialized.  
With initialization the correct types would be `int` and `short`.
